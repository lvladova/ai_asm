# Autonomous Delivery Drones Path Optimization and Weather Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing the routes of autonomous delivery drones and predicting weather conditions using various machine learning algorithms. The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Path Optimization for Drones**: Implementing and comparing search algorithms like A* Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimal pathfinding.
2. **Weather Prediction**: Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Markov Chain models to predict weather conditions.

## Project Structure

### Path Optimization

#### 1. A* Algorithm

- **Script**: `graph_a_start.py`
- **Description**: Implements the A* algorithm for finding the optimal path considering distance, traffic, and urgency.

#### 2. Genetic Algorithm

- **Script**: `ga.py`
- **Description**: Uses a genetic algorithm to evolve and refine paths for drones, optimizing for delivery times and operational costs.

#### 3. Ant Colony Optimization

- **Scripts**: `ant_colony.py`, `ant_colony_streamlit.py`
- **Description**: Simulates ant colony behavior to find the optimal path for drones, taking into account pheromone levels and heuristic information.

#### 4. Streamlit Application for Path Optimization

- **Script**: `streamlit_path_optimization.py`
- **Description**: A Streamlit application for visualizing the paths generated by the different algorithms. It allows the user to select the start and end nodes, choose the algorithm, and visualize the results interactively. Visit the app on - https://pathfinding.streamlit.app

### Weather Prediction

#### 1. LSTM Model

- **Scripts**: `lstm.py`, `reward_system_lstm.py`
- **Description**: Implements LSTM networks to predict future weather values based on historical data. The `reward_system_lstm.py` includes a reward system to enhance prediction accuracy.

#### 2. Markov Chain Model

- **Scripts**: `markov_chain.py`, `reward_system_markov.py`
- **Description**: Uses Markov Chain models for time-series prediction of weather data. The `reward_system_markov.py` includes a reward system for better performance.

#### 3. Combined Analysis and Visualization

- **Script**: `all_models.py`
- **Description**: Compares and visualizes the results of LSTM, LSTM with rewards, Markov Chain, and Markov Chain with rewards.
